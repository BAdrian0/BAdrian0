### Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹ 
### Nice to meet you!

I am a results-driven professional with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, as well as a passion for achieving success through teamwork. For many years, I have been passionate about software development and its practical applications in our day-to-day life, such as IoT and Smart Buildings. My aim is to create fun, comfortable, and healthier spaces to live in.

Over the past year, I have worked passionately to gain experience as a full-stack developer and acquire new skills, including the ability to learn new technologies with ease and write clean, maintainable code.
